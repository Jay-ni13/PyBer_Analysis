# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
Utilizing Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to summarize PyBer's 2019 ride-sharing data by city type and create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for urban, suburban, and rural cities to determine how that data differs by city type.
## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.13, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8
## Results
### Data Totals
    When categorized by city type, PyBer's overall ride-share data from 2019 indicates that across 120 urban, suburban, and rural cities, the majority of rides and drivers are located in urban cities, yet the average fare for rides is more expensive in suburban areas than urban areas, and even more expensive in rural areas.

    Though there are more drivers than rides requested in urban areas, suburban and rural cities have more rides requested than drivers; while the higher average fare for suburban and rural cities may play a role in the lower number of rides requested in those areas, the higher average fare for drivers offered in those rural and suburban cities prompts the research question: why are there much fewer drivers based in these areas?
### Fares Over Time
    Comparison of the total fares made every week in January, Feburary, March, and April of 2019 indicates that while urban cities unquestionably have the highest volume of fares, those fare sums are more impacted by outside influences than rural fares, which maintain a more comparable fare total from week to week.

    Based on this chart, an outside influence(s) caused fares to spike in both urban and suburban cities from late Feburary through early March. Which inspires the following questions: 
    -1 What was this influence(s)? 
    -2 Did ride requests in fact increase? or
    -3 Was something else causing fare prices to rise? (i.e. spring break)
## Summary
    The results of this analysis indicate the presence of disparities among the city types. To address those disparities, we recommend that CEO V. Isualize:
    -1 Investigate the distance rural drivers are requried to travel on average for their rides and how that impacts recruitment of more drivers in those more difficult        to reach areas. PyBer should look into offering gas stipends for rural drivers who have above average milage ride requests.
    -2 Determine the frequency that the circles for urban, suburban, and rural driver travel overlap: how often do they cross paths and how can that intersection be            utilized to expand PyBer's overall travel destination options by each driver's base location.
    -3 Use peak travel times as a potential way to increase base fare for drivers in all three city types.
